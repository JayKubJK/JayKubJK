# Hello there!
I see you've stumbled upon my profile. If you know me from school, well, hi lol. I'll be updating this as I see fit.

## ✨ About Me
* I'm a Colorado State University student going for a Bachelor's in 📊 Data Science
* I like playing video games in my free time; my favorites are ⛏️ *Minecraft*, 💭 *Resonite*, and 🃏 *Balatro*
* Yes, I'm a furry if you can't tell, and have been since about October 2019 :P

## 👾 Languages
I've dabbled in a lot of languages, and here's a list of them:

### Most familiar with

  <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/r/r-original.svg" title="R" alt="R" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp;
</div>

* I use these languages religiously as most of the classes I'm taking at school use these programming languages 
* I also like programming in Python specifically; C++ is my second favorite to write in

* I like C++ as I enjoy its type casting and how "low"-level it is
* I'm learning database programming and design, so SQL is a must ;P
* I don't really like Java's class-based methodology for programs, but programming in it is okay
* I've worked with JS for a bit now for side projects, but not being able to type-cast variables is driving me nuts.

* I don't really like C despite how low-level it is. It just doesn't feel right after having programmed in C++ for so long
* Scala is alright. With it being a more functional-focused language than object-oriented, it takes some time to get used to, especially working with Apache Spark
* Julia feels like a mash between Python and R
* Matlab feels like a true mathematical programming language, which is kind of the point of Matlab lol
* I've worked with Svelte, CSS, HTML, and JS for dabbling with web development and stuff. It's kinda fun, albeit tedious since I know next to nothing for front-end development
* I can't get behind Rust despite it being similar-ish to C++
* I would *love* to work with TypeScript for the type-casting and enum support, but I can't compile it for the life of me >:(
