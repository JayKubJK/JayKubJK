# Hello there!
I see you've stumbled upon my profile. If you know me from school, well, hi lol. I'll be updating this as I see fit.

## ✨ About Me
* I'm a 🏫 Colorado State University student going for a Bachelor's in 📊 Data Science
* I like playing video games in my free time; my favorites are ⛏️ *Minecraft* and 💭 *Resonite*
* Yes, I'm a furry if you can't tell, and have been since about October 2020 :P

## 👾 Languages
I've dabbled in a lot of languages, and here's a list of them:

### Most familiar with

  <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/r/r-original.svg" title="R" alt="R" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp;
</div>

* I use these languages religiously as most of the classes I'm taking at school use these programming languages 
* I also like programming in Python specifically; C++ is my second favorite to write in

* These are two programming languages that I use for the games they're from respectively. Click on the icons to go to the game they're from!

### Knowledgeable in

</div>

* I like C++ as I enjoy its type casting and how low-level it is
* I don't really like Java's class-based methodology for programs, but programming in it is okay

### Dabbled with
<div>
  <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/c/c-original.svg" title="C" alt="C" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp;
  <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/julia/julia-original.svg" title="Julia" alt="Julia" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp;
  <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/matlab/matlab-original.svg" title="MATLAB" alt="MATLAB" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp;
  <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/rust/rust-original.svg" title="Rust" alt="Rust" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp;
</div>

* I don't really like C despite how low-level it is. It just doesn't feel right after having programmed in C++ for so long
* Julia feels like a mash between Python and R
* Matlab feels like a true mathematical programming language, which is kind of the point of Matlab lol
* I can't get behind Rust despite it being similar-ish to C++
